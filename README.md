# Mental Health in the Workplace: Exploratory Data Analysis

This project investigates the impact of work location and industry on employee stress levels and mental health conditions using a dataset of 5,000 employees across diverse sectors. The analysis is aimed at uncovering patterns in burnout, anxiety, and depression and how they vary with remote, hybrid, and on-site work settings.

## Objectives

- Evaluate how different work locations affect employee stress levels.
- Examine industry-specific patterns in stress and mental health outcomes.
- Provide evidence to inform workplace mental health strategies and policies.

## Key Findings

- **Remote workers** reported higher average stress levels than hybrid or on-site employees.
- **Finance and healthcare** industries experienced the highest stress levels.
- **Burnout** is strongly correlated with high stress, while **anxiety and depression** present more complex patterns.
- The results suggest a need for **tailored mental health interventions** by industry and work style.

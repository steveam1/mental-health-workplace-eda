# Mental Health in the Workplace: Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository explores the impact of work location and industry on stress levels and mental health conditions among employees. Using a dataset of 5,000 individuals, this analysis investigates how different environments and sectors correlate with burnout, anxiety, and overall employee wellbeing.

## Objectives

- Assess stress levels across remote, hybrid, and on-site work arrangements.
- Identify industry-specific stress trends.
- Examine the relationship between stress and reported mental health conditions.

## Key Visualizations

### 1. Stress Level Distribution by Work Location

This network chart compares the average reported stress levels for remote, hybrid, and on-site workers. Hybrid workers unexpectedly reported the lowest average stress.
